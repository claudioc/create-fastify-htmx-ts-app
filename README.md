## Create Fastify + HTMX + Ts Application

This initializer will just download the [Fastify-HTMX-TypeScript](https://github.com/claudioc/fastify-htmx-ts-starter-kit) starter kit for you, creates an application directory and prepares a clean `package.json` for you to edit.

It doesn't work on Windows machines. Feel free to fix this :)

Usage:

```sh
npm create fastify-htmx-ts-app
# or
npx create-next-app@latest
# or
yarn create next-app
# or
pnpm create next-app
```
